                    <p>
                        DEBUT is a US based competition, strictly for undergraduate
                        students. The competition requires teams to identify a
                        clinical problem and build a fully functional prototype to
                        solve it. The deadline for submission is May 2020.<br>For

                    <p>
                        The team's current project is designing and prototyping an
                        exoskeleton for the workplace. The purpose of the
                        exoskeleton is to correct posture and reduce the load for
                        the back and shoulders. The exoskeleton will be able to
                        give users a 33% mechanical advantage, up to a full lift of
                        75lbs. This exoskeleton will also track motion and give
                        feedback to the user to prevent repetitive motion injuries
                        and unhealthy range of motion injuries.
