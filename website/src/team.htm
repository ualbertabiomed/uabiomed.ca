            <h4>George Felobes, Alicia MacDonald, Ben Hallworth</h4>
        <p>We are your Executives as well as the Club Founders. We are all third year biomedical mechanical engineering students. We started this group because we know a large amount of students are interested in biomedical studies, but, only a small number of people get selected into biomedical programs. So, we wanted to create a group for all students interested in biomed to explore this field of study. We are passionate about innovation and design and are very excited to work with you all on inventing some new technology.</p>


        <h3>Control and Power Team</h3>
        <p>The Control and Power Systems team will be working on the electrical side of things. This ranges from having a reliable source of power, to any automated control that the exoskeleton will require.</p>
        <p>Meets: DICE 1-220 every Monday from 5-6pm</p>

        <h3>Structural Team</h3>
        <p>The structural team is responsible for the form and shape of the exoskeleton. A large focus will be placed on ergonomics as well as the materials used to manufacture the system.</p>
        <p>Meets: DICE 1-230 every Thursday from 5-6pm</p>

        <h3>Clinical Team</h3>
        <p>The Clinical team will be the bridge between technology and the user. Their job is to study the human body, identify all problems and make sure that the technology can be implemented in a practical and safe way.</p>
        <p>Meets: DICE 8-226 every Monday from 6-7pm</p>
