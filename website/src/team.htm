        <p>We are your Executives as well as the Club Founders. We are all third year biomedical mechanical engineering students. We started this group because we know a large amount of students are interested in biomedical studies, but, only a small number of people get selected into biomedical programs. So, we wanted to create a group for all students interested in biomed to explore this field of study. We are passionate about innovation and design and are very excited to work with you all on inventing some new technology.</p>
